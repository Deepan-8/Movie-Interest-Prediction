ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation with ROC and Lift Curves : 
  This project demonstrates how to evaluate multiple classification models using ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves and Lift curves for performance comparison.

ðŸ§  Key Features
  1.Fits multiple classification models with hyperparameters
  2.Evaluates models using:
    ->ROC AUC Score
    ->ROC Curve
    ->Lift Curve
  3.Visualization of both ROC and Lift curves side-by-side
  4.Helps identify the most effective model for binary classification

ðŸš€ How to Use : 
  1.Load your dataset and perform preprocessing.
  2.Define your models and their best hyperparameters:
  3.Split your data into training and test sets.
  4.Call the evaluation function

ðŸ“š Concepts Used : 
  1.ROC AUC Score
  2.Lift Curve and Cumulative Response
  3.Model Probability Calibration
  4.Visualization with matplotlib
